TODO:
Add save points on the level and eliminate saving in interiors
Clean up the inventory screen and add proper [back] buttons
Ability to change screen size from options (Game already supports multiple screen sizes)

Planned:
Make sandbox mode and survival mode fun....
Real pathfinding using A*

Things I would like to change but not a top priority:
Make the launcher faster (Or create an option light launcher)
Make saving more efficient (Currently just saves the heap, very very bulky)
