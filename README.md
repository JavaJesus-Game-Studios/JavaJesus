# JavaJesus Game Studios: Blam! (Live Project)
Blam! is the currently untitled first Game from JavaJesus Game Studios. Blam! is a 2D Open World Real Time Role Playing Game. The Player can customize the look of their avatar, engage in ranged and melee combat with enemy NPC's and enter dialogue with friendly NPC's. The Game has been in on and off developement since September 2015, with developement periods of September 2015 - May 2016, July 2017 - August 2017, July 2018 - August 2018, and August 2019- present. This project is WIP software and is not ready for general download.

## Gameplay
### Questing and Dialogue
The main narrative of the Game is set during a Demonic invasion of the San Francisco Bay Area. The Player's character is tasked with determining the origins of the invasion and stopping it. The story features branching narratives and different factions to ally with or fight.
### Combat
The Player can engage in combat with enemies using both Guns and Swords. The combat is real time and features many different unique enemy types. From the basic Demon, to the Goongan and Chungus, there is a wide range of combat challenges presented to the Player Character, not to mention the many boss battles featured in the game, most notably against Satan and the Goose.

## Roadmap
The Studio is currently working on creating new Alpha Demo which will be representative of the beginning of the game. The Alpha will compose approximately the first quarter of Act I of the Main Quest and will also feature several Side Quests unrelated to the main narrative. The Demo will compose of a tutorial quest to introduce enemies and systems to the Player. This Demo will be given to select Play Testers to help use improve our combat, writing and quest design both for the portion of the Game included in the Alpha and the final release. Demo release expected in 2020 Q1.

## Release Date
There is currently no release date confirmed for the project. Internal targets are for late 2020 or 2021 release date.
