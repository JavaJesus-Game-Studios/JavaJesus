This is a Coders of Anarchy creation.

by the main developer.

There are three different game modes:
Adventure Mode (The Main Game)

Adventure Mode:
- Still in development, not ready for play
- Basic maps are layed out, but no proper NPC placement, buildings, or scripts have been placed
- Saving is compatible with this mode

Sandbox Mode:
- Randomly generated map
- Companion helps you fight
- Can explore caves and find chests
- No incentive to play (Will be updated sometime)

Survival Mode:

- Get as many kills as you can!
- Every kill makes it harder to stay alive
